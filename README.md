## Project Description
This project recreates the front page of the **Nawa-e-Waqt** newspaper from 17 December 1971 using HTML and inline CSS. The design mimics the vintage newspaper layout, including elements like the header, multiple article columns, images, and the footer. I aimed to provide a realistic representation of an old newspaper layout while using modern HTML5 standards.

## Features Implemented
- 3-column table layout for the main content area
- Header section with the newspaper name, date, and volume details
- Footer section with contact information and copyright notice
- Use of `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<article>` tags for semantic structure
- Inline CSS for styling, maintaining a clean vintage design
- Unordered and ordered lists for itemization and timelines

## Challenges Faced
One of the key challenges was creating a multi-column layout, which I solved by using `<table>` elements with percentage-based column widths. Additionally, maintaining consistent spacing across different browsers was challenging, but I overcame it by explicitly setting margins and padding using inline CSS.
